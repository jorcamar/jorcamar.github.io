# Aiding a City after a Natural Disaster: An Optimization Problem

> ‚ÄºÔ∏è This is just a summary for the project. **For reading the full steps, code and explanation, please [go to the Jupyter Notebook üìô.](notebooks/optimization-aid.html)**


## üìñ Project Description

Unfortunately, we once again saw the effects of the floods in the Valencia region. The floods of October 2024 caused enormous damage in many towns in the province of Valencia, but not in the capital. Why?

In 1957, Valencia experienced one of its worst floods, but it was the last one. As a result of this catastrophe, the course of the Turia, its river, was diverted, thus avoiding future floods, including this year's. Now, the people of the affected localities need this type of works to be able to continue living peacefully.

For this project, a model was created that simulates what would have happened if the new Turia riverbed had never been created and we had to provide help to the 16 districts of Valencia.

In the [notebook](notebooks/optimization-aid.html), every step of the work for both problems is detailed: the formulation of the problem, the implementation for optimization in Pyomo, an exploration of the posibilities that this model allows and insights into the results.
