> This project addresses the **binary classification problem** of detecting skin cancer using the **ISIC dataset** from a private Kaggle competition. The goal was to get the best possible accuracy in classifying images and metadata into **cancerous** and **benign** lesions, despite the severe class imbalance in the dataset, using methods for both data types: from simple, tabular models to complex, pre-trained and fine-tuned CNNs.

> For my Physics Degree thesis, I researched and Probabilistic Quantum clustering, an unsupervised ML method that uses the SchrÃ¶dinger's equation to perform effective and flexible clustering, and applied it to physics problems from astrophysics and particle physics.

</a>

> In this project, the weekly sales for a company had to be predicted for half a year based on the data from the two previous years. The best possible combination of preprocessing, feature engineering and ML model had to be found for getting the best performance on a hidden test set; while also analyzing deeply how the features were related to the sales to extract key insights.

## [Advanced Time-series Models for Forecasting](/shares_time_series)
**Shares Values and Volumes Predictions**

</a>

> For this challenge, a dataset made of 32 time-series with weekly frequency had to be used for modelling the best possible forecast for the next whole year. With only 2 years for training and time-series with different behaviours and interactions between them, the 16 features relating the shares had to be predicted. For it, several advanced models for forecasting (ETS, SARIMAX, VARX, XGBoost...) were trained and tested to select the best.
